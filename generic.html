								<h3>Origins
								</h3>
								<p>When I had turned six years old, my uncle had gifted me a Gameboy Silver for my birthday. I remember spending countless hours playing classic titles like Tak and the Power of Juju and Crash Bandicoot. As technologies began to improve and studios began to create the next generation of games for consoles like the Playstation 2, Playstation 3, and Xbox 360, I fell in love with first and third person shooters as well as single player action adventue games. These widely successful titles such as, Naughty Dog's Uncharted Series, EA's Battlefield and Star Wars games, Bungie's Halo and Destiny series etc. played major contributions for me to seek out a career in the digital world of entertainment. </p>

								<p>After completing highschool, I applied to the Virginia Polytechnic and State University to pursue a degree in Nanoscience and try out for their Wrestling team. I had worked very hard academically and even made the team my first semester, but came to realize I desperately needed to change majors. I came across a brand new major titled "Creative Technologies". After further research I decided to switch upon finising my first semester. Since then, I have worked consistenly to improve my artwork and one day work at a studio of my dreams.</p>

								<h4>Personal Life</h4>
								<p>Besides working on the computer, I have been involved with mixed martial arts and wrestling since I was 6 years old. I enjoy speaking about philosophy and scientifc theories about evolution and ancient history. I love to scuba dive, play sand volleyball, and hike in the summer. Just being outside in general brings me lots of joy. I am a huge fan of Paulo Coehlo's many books and love to read when ever I find some down time. Although I do focus mainly in digital creation, I do thoroughly enjoy experimenting with sculpture work and creating art from every day objects. I am a very positive individual who thrives under pressure and highly adaptable to anything thrown my way.  </p>

								<p>I am very personable and love to connect with other artists and individuals who enjoy 3D art. As I progress through my career I eventually one day would like to be an Art Director or Storyline creator at a talented studio, working with some of the best in the business. Until then, I am actively seeking employment and work opportunites that can further progress my art work through the eyes of millions.  </p>
